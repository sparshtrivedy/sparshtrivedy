                JavaScript can also handle requests and responses on a website. It's a great language to master for front-end and back-end web

                    Software Engineering and Web Development, Front-end Web Development in particular.

                    When I am not working, you can find me curled up on the couch reading a book, doing digital sketches or cafe hopping 
                    around Vancouver.

                            This is a REST API that is used to keep track of an individual's personal budget. A user can add categories to/remove categories from their 
                            budget and assign a balance amount to each category. 
                            <br><br>
                            Any debit or credit is reflected on the remaining balance. We also have a separate table of transactions
                            that keeps track of any and all transactions between the categories of our budget. 
                            <br><br>
                            We have two separate tables - one for the personal budget with its different categories, and one for the transactions between these categories with their 
                            dates and amounts. Any change in one of these tables is reflected on the other. 
                            <br><br>
                            The database, with these tables, is deigned using PostgreSQL and the server that handles the HTTP requests is designed using Express. The server and 
                            database are connected using node-postgres and this API is documented using Swagger API.

                            This application, implemented in C++, uses a binary tree (PTree) to represent an image. The nodes of this tree represent rectangular 
                            regions of a PNG image. 
                            <br><br>
                            Operations on this tree allow us to Prune the tree which results in a more pixelated image. The Prune function attempts, starting 
                            near the top of a freshly built tree, to remove all the descendants of a node, if all of the leaf nodes below the current 
                            node have colour within tolerance of the node's average colour. This application also allows us to flip an image both horizontally 
                            and vertically. The effects of these operations can be observed using the render function which renders an image using the root node
                            of a tree as an input.

                            This is an interactive coffee ordering application, implemented in Java, that allows a user to add/remove drinks 
                            from the shopping cart, view order summary, generate bill and place an order.

                            This application makes use of an API that allows its users to save and load their orders. It also keeps a log each 
                            time a drink is added or removed from the cart. The Java Swing library was used to add a Graphical User Interface 
                            and make the application more user friendly. This application was designed with software design principles in mind 
                            and tested using JUnit.
