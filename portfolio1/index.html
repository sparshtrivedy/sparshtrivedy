                    I am in the formiTable scrum team and we focus on developing the forms and tables on Cambio, a cloud-hosted software solution that is designed to help engineers take a systematic approach toward managing infrastructure.

                    At BGC, we primarily use .NET(C#) for developing the back-end and React.js(TypeScript) for the front-end. Some of the exciting features I worked on include:

                            The Instrument Reading attribute table was created to store data associated with the instrument readings.
                            <br><br>
                            This involved creating a DB view, joining multiple tables to grab all the data required for the attribute table. A data model was also created for the view. GET and POST API end-points were created to fetch and 
                            update the table as readings were added, updated and removed from the table. Linq queries were used to filter the readings based on the client viewing the data.
                            <br><br>
                            Quick actions were added to zoom to the instrument locations, view/edit the detailed readings through the form, filter the table based on the 
                            columns and download the readings selected as PDFs.
                            <br><br>
                            Data seeding for the table was performed using Entity Framework migrations.

                            This is a modal popup for when a user wants to add new inspections to a strain feature. 
                            The user here has the option to either manually fill in all data through the form, or they can copy over data
                            from a previously created inspection at the same or different strain feature.
                            <br><br>
                            The modal has a checkbox a user can check if they want to copy data from another inspection. An end-point was implemented to copy over
                            the data from the source inspection to the target inspection. The modal has dropdowns for the target and source strain
                            features, which users can filter by keyword. This functionality was added with the help of an end-point to filter the
                            strain features by keyword. The modal also has a list of inspections that a user can copy data from. This list is populated 
                            based on the source strain feature selected by the user.

                            We had been working on developing a new Instrumentation Module for our clients.
                            We had been developing this on a demo client and when all the features were ready to go, I was tasked with enabling it for 5 of our clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This involved running a tool created by our team lead, to associate all our instruments with a new Instrument Location, based on their coordinates.
                            A new Instrument Location layer was then enabled for these 5 clients through SQL scripts. Data seeding was done through EF migrations, to enable the
                            tables and forms for these clients.

                            I updated our controller to have one generic end-point for all our enums. This dramatically reduced the size of our controller and also
                            saved a lot of time for devs creating new enums, since they no longer have to create a new end-point for every enum.

                            WoodWorks is a full-stack web application implemented in TypeScript, React and Redux on the front-end and C# and .NET on the back-end. 
                            <br><br>
                            This is an e-commerce web application with a products catalog where users can view the product details, add products to the cart and 
                            update the quantity of these products in the cart. The DB schema has been set-up using the code first approach of Entity Framework and 
                            the data seeding for the DB tables was done using EF migrations. An REST API controller was set-up with CRUD end-points for fetching products,
                            fetching basket items, updating basket items and deleting basket items. The back-end functionality has been supported by front-end functionality
                            implemented with the help of TypeScript, React and Redux.

                            This is a REST API that is used to keep track of an individual's personal budget. A user can add categories to/remove categories from their 
                            budget and assign a balance amount to each category.

                            Any debit or credit is reflected on the remaining balance. We also have a separate table of transactions
                            that keeps track of any and all transactions between the categories of our budget. 
                            <br><br>
                            We have two separate tables - one for the personal budget with its different categories, and one for the transactions between these categories with their 
                            dates and amounts. Any change in one of these tables is reflected on the other.

                            The database, with these tables, is deigned using PostgreSQL and the server that handles the HTTP requests is designed using Express. The server and 
                            database are connected using node-postgres and this API is documented using Swagger API.

                            This application, implemented in C++, uses a binary tree (PTree) to represent an image. The nodes of this tree represent rectangular

                            Operations on this tree allow us to Prune the tree which results in a more pixelated image. The Prune function attempts, starting 
                            near the top of a freshly built tree, to remove all the descendants of a node, if all of the leaf nodes below the current 
                            node have colour within tolerance of the node's average colour. This application also allows us to flip an image both horizontally 
                            and vertically. The effects of these operations can be observed using the render function which renders an image using the root node

                            This is an interactive coffee ordering application, implemented in Java, that allows a user to add/remove drinks 
                            from the shopping cart, view order summary, generate bill and place an order. 
                            <br><br> 
                            This application makes use of an API that allows its users to save and load their orders. It also keeps a log each 
                            time a drink is added or removed from the cart. The Java Swing library was used to add a Graphical User Interface 
                            and make the application more user friendly. This application was designed with software design principles in mind 
                            and tested using JUnit.
