                    - Implemented a modal dialogue that allows users to copy data from existing inspections into a form when adding new inspections, saving them a lot of time spent copy-pasting the same data repeatedly.<br/>
                    - Created a searchable dropdown component that allows users to filter through all the users from their organization. This component is used across all our forms, improving the overall user experience.<br/>
                    - Developed an attribute table to store and organize all instrumentation data, accompanied by <span class="green">REST API</span> endpoints to fetch data based on client, making the data more accessible to clients.<br/>
                    - Refactored and optimized our enums API controller, condensing the individual endpoints into one generic endpoint for all the enums, reducing our file size and making it easier to understand.<br/>
                    - Added tags to our attachment manager allowing users to add new and re-use existing tags to categorize and organize their attachments, making them more identifiable.<br/>

                            WoodWorks is a full-stack web application implemented in TypeScript, React and Redux on the front-end and C# and .NET on the back-end. 
                            <br><br>
                            This is an e-commerce web application with a products catalog where users can view the product details, add products to the cart and 
                            update the quantity of these products in the cart. The <span class="green">DB schema</span> has been set-up using the code first approach of <span class="green">Entity Framework</span> and 
                            the data seeding for the DB tables was done using EF migrations. A REST API controller was set-up with <span class="green">CRUD end-points</span> for fetching products,
                            fetching basket items, updating basket items and deleting basket items.
                            <br><br>
                            Sorting and filtering functionality was added so users can filter the products by a brand or type, and even sort the
                            products by price. Users may also use the search bar to filter products by keyword.
                            <br><br>
                            A login and register feature was also added for users to access our exclusive catalog of furniture!

                            This is a REST API that is used to keep track of an individual's personal budget. A user can add categories to/remove categories from their

                            Any debit or credit is reflected on the remaining balance. We also have a separate table of transactions
                            that keeps track of any and all transactions between the categories of our budget. 
                            <br><br>
                            We have two separate tables - one for the personal budget with its different categories, and one for the transactions between these categories with their 
                            dates and amounts. Any change in one of these tables is reflected on the other.

                            This application, implemented in <span class="green">C++</span>, uses a <span class="green">binary tree</span> (PTree) to represent an image. The nodes of this tree represent rectangular

                            Operations on this tree allow us to Prune the tree which results in a more pixelated image. The Prune function attempts, starting 
                            near the top of a freshly built tree, to remove all the descendants of a node, if all of the leaf nodes below the current 
                            node have colour within tolerance of the node's average colour. This application also allows us to flip an image both horizontally 
                            and vertically. The effects of these operations can be observed using the render function which renders an image using the root node
