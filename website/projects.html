	<h3>Cafe Kiosk (December 2021)</h3>
	<p>An interactive coffee ordering application. The application allows the user to add drinks to cart, remove drinks from cart, view order summary, place order and generate bill. The application also loggs and keeps track of when a drink is added or removed from the cart. I implemented the Json reader and writer classes to add saving and loading functionality. I used the Java Swing library to add a graphical user interface to make the application more user friendly. The application was written with software design principles in mind.</p>
	<p>Languages: Java <br> <br>

	<h3>Image Partitioning Trees (March 2022)</h3>
	<p>Constructed a PTree(a binary tree whose nodes represent rectangular regions of a PNG image). Implemented the render function to contruct the PNG. Implemented the Prune function which attempts, starting near the top of a freshly built tree, to remove all of the descendants of a node, if all of the leaf nodes below the current node have colour within tolerance of the node's average colour. Pruning degrades the image quality. Finally, I implemented two additional functions to flip the PTree horizontally and vertically.</p>
	<p>Languages: C++ <br> <br>

	<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
	<h3>Personal Website (January 2022)</h3>
	<p>This was my first web-development project which I use to display all my work. I wrote out the entire skeleton of the website in HTML and styled it using CSS.</p>
	<p>Languages: HTML, CSS</p>
	<h3>Image Detector (April 2022)</h3>
	<p>A frontend application that allows a user to enter an image url and detects the object in the image. I used the Clarifai-API, an API that uses machine learning to detect the object in an image. I selected the top 5 most probable results to display to the user. The image corresponding to the url is also displayed along with the result.</p>
	<p>Languages: JavaScript, CSS</p>
	<p>Framework: ReactJS <br> <br>
