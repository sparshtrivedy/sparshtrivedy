### Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase my projects and share my experiences with you. As a computer science major and a dedicated full stack web developer, I bring a diverse skill set and a passion for creating innovative solutions.

#### About Me ‚òïÔ∏è
I'm a CS major who finds joy in exploring the vast world of programming and thrives on exploring new technologies and continuously expanding his skill set. I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in the latest developments in the field of web development and self-teaching these emerging technologies. Keeping up-to-date with the ever-evolving landscape of programming is a personal commitment that drives my professional growth. When I'm not immersed in code, you can often find me exploring different cafes, seeking inspiration and enjoying a delightful cup of iced latte. This combination of technical expertise and creativity fuels my motivation to deliver exceptional results in web development.

#### Professional Experience üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
I have had the privilege of gaining valuable experience as a web developer co-op at BGC Engineering, where I actively contributed to their proprietary software that helps geoscientists manage infrastructure, visualize their assets and hazards, and monitor impacts in real-time. Working with technologies like .NET and React, I gained a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development, enabling me to contribute to all aspects of the application development lifecycle. This included designing database schemas, implementing RESTful APIs, building user interfaces, and ensuring efficient communication between the front-end and back-end systems. Collaborating with a diverse team of professionals further enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team-oriented environment.

Currently, I am engaged in part-time web development at UBC's Faculty of Forestry. In this role, I have gained valuable experience contributing to the development of the TA application portal. As part of the development team, I have leveraged my skills in Django to create robust and user-friendly features for the portal. Additionally, I have been actively involved in the redesign of courses within the faculty to improve accessibility. This role has provided me with a deeper understanding of the importance of inclusive design and the impact it can have on students with diverse needs.

#### Technologies and Specializations ‚ú®
In my web development journey, I have acquired proficiency in a variety of technologies and frameworks. These include:

Backend development: I have hands-on experience working with Express, .NET framework, and Django to build robust web applications.
Frontend development: I am well-versed in React.js, a popular JavaScript library, for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Serverless Development: I have practical experience developing serverless architectures using Amazon Web Services (AWS). This includes working with services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to build highly scalable and cost-effective applications.
